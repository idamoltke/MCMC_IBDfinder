# MCMC_IBDfinder
This is an old program (from 2011) for estimating probabilities of IBD sharing among multiple individuals. 

I have not been updated for a while but have added it here to make sure it is avaiable in case someone finds it potentially useful (I still use it myself from time to time :-))

The method that is implemented in the program is described in this Genome Reseach paper: https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2011/04/14/gr.115360.110.abstract
