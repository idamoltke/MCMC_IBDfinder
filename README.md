# MCMC_IBDfinder
This is an old c++ program (from 2011) for estimating probabilities of identity by descent (IBD) sharing among multiple individuals. 

More specifically, it estimates posterior probabilities of IBD sharing between multiple individuals using unphased single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) data. The program is an implementation of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method described in this Genome Research paper: https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2011/04/14/gr.115360.110.abstract 
 
It is currently not available for windows. Also, it has not updated for a while, but has been added here to make sure it is avaiable in case someone finds it potentially useful (I still use it myself from time to time :-))
